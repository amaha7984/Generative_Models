# Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Flow Matching in Latent Space (Unsupervised Domain Translation)

- This project explores the development of generative models based on the Flow Matching principle introduced by Lipman et al.
- Reference: https://github.com/facebookresearch/flow_matching
- We investigate optimal path construction between two unknown distributions without requiring paired input–target images.
- We have also explored patch-wise feature correspondence with DINOv3.
